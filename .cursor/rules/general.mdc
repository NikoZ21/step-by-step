# General Coding Rules

## Language Standards

- Always use TypeScript

## Component Props Interface Naming

- Every time we create a component, their props interface should be named "Props"

## Component Structure

- When creating a "foldered component", create a folder inside the components folder and put an index.tsx file in that folder. The folder name will be specified in the chat when needed.
